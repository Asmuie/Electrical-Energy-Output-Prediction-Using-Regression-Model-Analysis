# Regression

* **[Regression](https://github.com/Asmuie/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Regression)** : A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators.In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, the other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance. Using the data provided, I had predict the Energy Output (PE) using regression model below. Finally i compare the r2_score to find the best possible model for this project.
 
  * Multiple Linear Regression
 
  * Polynomial Regression
 
  * Support Vector Regresion (SVR)
 
  * Decision Tree Regression

  * Random Forest Regression
 
By using r2_score method we can evaluate our regression model preformance and compare it with other model. The r2_score show that, with a Random Forest Regression model, we can predict Energy Produced with 96.15% of accuracy.
